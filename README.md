## Github pages : https://aaronjr.github.io/battleship/

- Test Driven Development used to implement the classic game ‘Battleship’. 

- The game will randomly lay out your ships on the left hand board, checking the ships don't overlay each other or fall from the board. You attack on the right board.  

- You then take shots against the computer to see who can sink the others ships first. 

- Health of opponents ships on the right side of the screen.
